## 🚀 About Me

Always seeking new technological frontiers, I have over 10 years of experience in software development, exploring operating systems, genetic algorithms, artificial intelligence, and data science.

My journey led me to help foster the research community for the Royal Game of UR on the main Discord server, making a playable AI based on academic research accessible for the first time.

I also founded **BorIA**, the first AI and tech innovation community in Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, with a mission to develop and share knowledge in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies in the region.

My technical expertise is paired with a human approach and a touch of humor.
